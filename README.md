# vips-benchmarks

The goal of this repo is to demonstrate the performance of the libvips
library in comparison to other image processing systems. Currently an accent
on [ruby-vips](https://github.com/jcupitt/ruby-vips): Ruby bindings for
libvips library, is made.

Be sure to check out the official benchmarks page: [VIPS - Speed and Memory
Use](https://github.com/jcupitt/libvips/wiki/Speed-and-memory-use)
for complete demonstration of performance and memory usage characteristics
of VIPS library.

## Performance test design

The repo has folders _ruby/_, _cpp/_ and others, each having platform
specific scripts using various libraries available for this platform.

Each script is coded to execute the same scenario (see Scenario section).

Root folder contains _runner_ script, running
scripts available in all folders.

See "Do it yourself" section for how to run benchmark scenario.

## Scenario

Test scenario was taken from [Speed and Memory
use](https://github.com/jcupitt/libvips/wiki/Speed-and-memory-use)
page from libvips [Home
page](https://jcupitt.github.io/libvips/). The test is
repeated 10 times. 

## Do it yourself

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jcupitt/vips-benchmarks

cd vips-benchmarks

bundle update

bundle exec ./runner 
```
